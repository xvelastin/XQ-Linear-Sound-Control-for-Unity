# XQShowControl
An early-stage plugin for Unity for controlling sound cues for linear playback. Use the unity package or grab just the scripts. To install a Unity package, download it to some place (eg. Unity/Packages), then from an existing Unity project, go to Assets/Import Package/Custom Package and navigate to the XQShowControl.unitypackage file. This will bring the folder structure into your project. I'm aware I haven't followed conventions for Unity Packages - this will be rectified on release.

## Documentation
When I get a chance I'll document this properly here. For now, you can have a look at the code and I've commented it up. There is also a "demo" folder if you open the unity package, which contains a small demo scene with a couple of implementation examples.

## License
This isn't released yet - it's not been tested properly and I don't know its issues, so I would rather it not be distributed outside of the people I share it with. For that reason, I reserve the rights to it. This will probably change once I have a stable release out.
